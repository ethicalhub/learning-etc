## Strings

- Immutability refers to the idea that once an object is created, it cannot be changed. This concept is often applied to strings, and it helps with memory efficiency and performance.
- String Pool: Languages like Java or Python use a "string pool" (or "string internment"). This is essentially a collection of all unique string values that have been used in a program. The idea is that if two variables hold the same string, they don’t need to occupy separate spots in memory—they can both point to the same location in the string pool.
- Reuse Memory: When a string is immutable, the value of the string cannot change. So, if you try to change the string (e.g., adding "s" to the end of "string" to make it "strings"), instead of altering the original string, a new string instance is created, and it’s added to the string pool. The variable then points to this new string.
- No Memory Waste: By reusing strings in the string pool, the language minimizes memory usage. Instead of creating a new string in memory each time, it can reuse an existing one from the pool. If the same string "apple" appears multiple times, it only takes up memory once, no matter how many times it's used in the program.

# Key Concepts of Strings

Definition: A string is an array of characters stored in a specific order.
Immutability: In many programming languages, strings are immutable (e.g., in Java and Python).

Modifications create a new string instead of altering the original.
Common Operations:
Length: len(string) or string.length
Access by Index: string[i]
Concatenation: + operator or concat() methodsg
Substrings: string[start:end]
Reversal: Using loops or built-in functions
Comparison: ==, compareTo() in Java, or localeCompare() in JavaScript

# Integer Revision Notes in JavaScript

## **What is an Integer in JavaScript?**

- An **integer** is a whole number (positive, negative, or zero) without any fractional or decimal part.
- JavaScript represents all numbers (including integers and floating-point numbers) using the **Number** type, which is based on the IEEE 754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic.

---

## **Characteristics of Integers in JavaScript**

1. **Range**:

   - Safe integers are integers that can be accurately represented without rounding errors.
   - Range: `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` (-9007199254740991) to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (9007199254740991).
   - Use `Number.isSafeInteger()` to check if a number is within this range.

2. **Precision**:

   - JavaScript handles integers up to 15 significant digits accurately.
   - Beyond this, the precision may be lost due to floating-point limitations.

3. **Dynamic Typing**:
   - JavaScript does not differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers in its type system.
   - `typeof 42` and `typeof 42.0` both return `"number"`.

## **Basic Operations on Integers**

- **Arithmetic**:
  - Includes addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), modulus (`%`), and exponentiation (`**`).
- **Comparison**:
  - Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `===`, `!==`) can be used to compare integers.
- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - Logical operations at the binary level, such as AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`).

## **Working with Integers in JavaScript**

### **Declaration and Identification**

- JavaScript automatically interprets integers when declared:

  ```javascript
  const num = 42; // Integer

  Number.isInteger(value)
  Math.floor(), Math.ceil(), or Math.trunc()
  Number.isNaN(parseInt("abc")); // true
  ```

## Array

- Arrays can be created statically or dynamically. In a static language, the array would be kept on the stack and require that the array type be specified a priori. Dynamic languages offer more fluidity, sometimes calling for the size to be set and do not require the type to be specified before use. Such an instance would be stored on a heap. Arrays have indexes, which is a contiguous value starting at 0 and increasing until the end of the array. When an item is required, the array's name followed by square brackets and the index location are given.

- An item can be stored in heap or stack memory. Stack memory is created when running a function. It is created for that function and discarded after the execution. Items in this memory allocation are only available for that function. In contrast, heap memory is created during the execution of instructions and is available to all.

- Two memory-related concepts you may encounter are shallow copy and deep copy. The first instance does not make a copy of the array but returns an index location. A deep copy will create a new instance of an array. Making a shallow copy optimizes memory usage; however, you must ensure that no unexpected changes are inadvertently made to an array shared by two variables.

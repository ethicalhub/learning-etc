# Two pointers

Two pointer approach is a technique used to solve problems that involve searching, sorting, or manipulating two pointers in an array or linked list.

- Low, high
- Only work in sorted array.

```javascript copy
// Two Pointer method in JavaScript
const arrayMain = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
let target = 12;

const twoPointerMethod = (array, target) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = array.length - 1;
  while (low < high) {
    const sum = array[low] + array[high];
    if (sum === target) {
      console.log(low, high);
      return;
    } else if (sum > target) {
      high = high - 1;
    } else if (sum < target) {
      low = low + 1;
    }
  }
};

twoPointerMethod(arrayMain, target);
```

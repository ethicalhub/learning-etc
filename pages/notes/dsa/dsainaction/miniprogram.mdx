# Two pointers

Two pointer approach is a technique used to solve problems that involve searching, sorting, or manipulating two pointers in an array or linked list.

- Low, high
- Only work in sorted array.

```javascript copy
// Two Pointer method in JavaScript
const arrayMain = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
let target = 12;

const twoPointerMethod = (array, target) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = array.length - 1;
  while (low < high) {
    const sum = array[low] + array[high];
    if (sum === target) {
      console.log(low, high);
      return;
    } else if (sum > target) {
      high = high - 1;
    } else if (sum < target) {
      low = low + 1;
    }
  }
};

twoPointerMethod(arrayMain, target);
```

## Slow and Fast Pointer (Tortoise and Hare algorithm)

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

- The slow pointer moves one step at a time.
- The fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

```javascript copy
// Slow and Fast pointer method in JavaScript

case1: [3, 2, 0, -4];
case2: [1, 2];
case3: [1];

var hasCycle = function (head) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;

  while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;

    if (slow === fast) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

## Reverseing an Array

```javascript copy
const array1 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 5];

const reverseArray = (arr) => {
  let temp;
  for (let i = 0, j = arr.length - 1; i <= j; i++, j--) {
    temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[j];
    arr[j] = temp;
  }
  return arr;
};

reverseArray(array1);

// expected result = [5,1,6,5,4,3]
```

## Palindrome

- If a reverse of string is equal to the actual string, then that word is palindrome.

```javascript copy

DIY (create a function palindrome)
// palindrome('abbc') => false
// palindrome('abba') => true

```

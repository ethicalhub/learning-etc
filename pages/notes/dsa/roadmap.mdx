# 40-Day DSA Roadmap for JavaScript

Here's the roadmap for the DSA journey I'm following as my revision plan to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare effectively for frontend interviews.

- Start Date: Jan 21, 2025

## Phase 1: Fundamentals (Days 1–8)

### Day 1–2: Big O Notation

- Understanding time and space complexity.
- Best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
- Common complexities: O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²), etc.
- Practice analyzing simple loops and nested loops.

### Day 3–4: Arrays

- **Practice Problems:**
  - Two Sum
  - Maximum Product Subarray
  - Rotate Array

### Day 5: Strings

- Manipulation: Substring, split, reverse, and palindrome check.
- **Common Algorithms:**
  - Anagram checks
  - Longest substring without repeating characters
  - Count vowels/consonants

### Day 6: Linear and Binary Search

- **Linear Search:** Implementation, best and worst cases.
- **Binary Search:**
  - Iterative and recursive implementations.
  - **Practice Problems:**
    - Search in a rotated sorted array
    - First and last position of an element in a sorted array

### Day 7–8: Sorting Algorithms

- **Day 7:** Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort.
- **Day 8:** Merge sort, Quick sort.
- **Practice:** Sorting arrays with duplicates and custom comparator functions.

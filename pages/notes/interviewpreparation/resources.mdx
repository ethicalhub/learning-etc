  # What Type of Interviews Might You Expect?

## Introduction

Getting a job involves jumping through several hoops. After compiling your résumé, identifying suitable job opportunities, filling in applications, and researching companies, you will begin to receive interview offers. The aim of an interview is to find a good match between the company and the candidate. Every company is different, and each conducts the interview process in its own way.

In this reading, you will learn about what is involved in a coding interview, such as:

- What the screening process entails.
- The type of quiz questions you might encounter.
- What an online assignment might consist of.
- The details of a technical interview.
- Any take-home assignments that you might be asked to complete.

## Screening

The first contact you will have with a company is typically a **screening interview**. A recruiter, having reviewed your application, will arrange a phone call to discuss your potential suitability. This stage aims to determine if you are genuinely interested in the role and whether you are a good fit for the company.

This is also an excellent opportunity for you, as a candidate, to learn more about the role, the company, and their hiring process. Some great questions to ask might include:

- What is the role?
- What coding language does the company typically use?
- What is the interview process, and how many interviews will there be?
- What is the nature of the project the proposed role is for?
- What is the typical makeup of the team?
- Who will be on the interview panel, and what is their role in the company?

From the company’s perspective, the screening will focus on **soft skills** or interpersonal abilities. There will be no technical questions, and the screening is typically conducted by a Human Resources (HR) representative. Presenting yourself well and demonstrating your communication skills—such as listening and responding thoughtfully—is essential.

## Quiz

A **quiz** is a straightforward way to establish if a candidate knows how to code. Conducted early in the interview process, it acts as a filter to reduce the number of interviews a company must conduct. The questions will generally assess basic coding knowledge, such as:

- How do you test for nulls in an array in a language of your choice?
- What is the space complexity for Quicksort?
- Which data structure would you use to store a list of keys and values?
- What is a collision in hashing?
- What is the syntax to select a column name using SQL?
- What testing processes are you familiar with?

The questions are job-specific but concise. When preparing, identify which programming languages and tools the company uses, as noted in the job posting or screening.

## Online Coding Assignment

You may be asked to complete an **online coding assignment**, often before a technical interview. These assignments allow you to solve a clearly defined task in a **non-pressurized environment**. Some assignments are timed, while others allow you to work at your own pace. You might use Google or other reference material.

Assignments generally test fundamental skills, such as:

- Loops
- Booleans
- Conditional checks

The results may be discussed in subsequent interviews or compared with other candidates.

## Technical Interview

The **technical interview**, also called a **coding challenge**, usually follows the screening process. It may be conducted virtually or in person. The interviewer will present a challenging problem and ask you to solve it in a short period.

It is essential to **explain your thought process aloud**. For example, when deciding between two data structures, discuss why one is more appropriate than the other. Demonstrate problem-solving skills and general understanding rather than focusing solely on syntax.

Common prompts include:

- How would you explain technology X to a non-technical person?
- What is your favorite technology and why?
- What databases have you worked with?
- Tell me about a technical challenge you have overcome in a project.
- What projects have you worked on in your spare time?

Preparation involves reviewing your past projects and understanding the decisions you made, especially when choosing specific technologies.

## Take-Home Assignment

If you get to the **take-home assignment**, you are likely a strong candidate. This step may occur before or after the technical interview. It involves a more comprehensive task, such as:

- Building an application.
- Solving a traffic routing problem programmatically.
- Demonstrating specific skills (e.g., detecting objects in a video feed for a vision processing role).

You will typically have **several days** to complete the task, and the interviewers may discuss your solution in subsequent rounds.

## Top Tips

1. Conduct research before every interview.
2. Review each interview afterward to identify areas for improvement.
3. Ask for feedback from the company after your interview.
4. Practice regularly to hone your skills.

## Conclusion

In this reading, you learned about what is involved in a coding interview, including:

- The screening process.
- The type of quiz questions you might encounter.
- Online coding assignments.
- The details of a technical interview.
- Take-home assignments.

Each company has its preferred format, which may involve one or more of these approaches. Remember, **every interview is a learning process**. If you miss a question or struggle with a concept, use the opportunity to learn more and improve for the next time.
